I don't think we unify MainComponent and SamplePlayback
  - Maybe juce audio processor node? ProcessorTree

Invert tempo change, change engine and GUI responds
  - Keys call engine funcs and engine clamps vals

Remove states, why was this here in the first place

Continuous click so that SamplePlayback updates samples between on tempo change



Talk:

Install juce
Setting up cmake
Juce Binary Data for click data
A word about unity/jumbo builds
Look and feel for metronome
Listeners and callbacks for sliders, textboxes, buttons
Process block and sample counting
